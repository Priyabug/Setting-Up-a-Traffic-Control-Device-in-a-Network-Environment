# Implementation and Configuration of a Network Access Control Gateway

## 📌 Description  
The learning objective of this lab is two-fold:  

1. **Understanding how firewalls work**  
2. **Setting up a simple firewall for a network**  

 A **stateless packet-filtering firewall** is implemented, which inspects packets and decides whether to **drop** or **forward** them based on firewall rules. Through this implementation task, students will grasp the **basic concepts of firewall functionality**.  

Linux has a built-in firewall based on **Netfilter**, known as **iptables**. Students will be given a **simple network topology** and asked to configure **iptables rules** to protect the network. This project will also explore **interesting applications of iptables**.  

### 🔥 Topics Covered  
- **Firewall**  
- **Netfilter**  
- **Loadable Kernel Module**  
- **Using iptables to set up firewall rules**  
- **Various applications of iptables**
