# Setting Up a Traffic Control Device in a Network Environment

## 📌 Description  
The learning objective of this lab is two-fold:  

1. **Understanding how firewalls work**  
2. **Setting up a simple firewall for a network**
3. **Distribution of Load Balancers traffic**

 A **stateless packet-filtering firewall** is implemented, which inspects packets and decides whether to **drop** or **forward** them based on firewall rules. Through this implementation task, we will be able to grasp the  **basic concepts of firewall functionality**.  

Linux has a built-in firewall based on **Netfilter**, known as **iptables**. Students will be given a **simple network topology** and asked to configure **iptables rules** to protect the network. This project will also explore **interesting applications of iptables**.  

### 🔥 Topics Covered  
- **Firewall**  
- **Netfilter**  
- **Loadable Kernel Module**  
- **Using iptables to set up firewall rules**  
- **Various applications of iptables**
- **LDAP for Centralized authentication**
- **NFS as a shared resource**

## 🔚 Conclusion

This lab provided **hands-on experience** with fundamental firewall concepts by implementing a **stateless packet-filtering firewall** and configuring firewall rules using Linux's `iptables`.

Through this exercise, we explored:

- How **packet inspection** and **rule-based filtering** safeguard a network from unauthorized access.
- The integral role of **Netfilter** in the Linux kernel.
- Real-world applications of **firewall rule management**.

This foundational understanding sets the stage for delving into more **advanced topics in network security**, firewall architectures, and dynamic rule-based threat mitigation.
